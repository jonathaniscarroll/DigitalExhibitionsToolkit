        <br><br> An interplay of machines, monsters, medicine, riots and speculative
        fictions, Hypercity is a culmination of a Long Winter residency wherein emerging
        artists <b>Cheyenne Rain LeGrande </b><b>\u146D\u14A5\u140A\u1427\u1423</b>,
        <b>cassraa</b>, <b>Malik McKoy</b>, <b>Vasuki Shanmuganathan</b>, and <b>Shonee\_</b>developed
        their artistic practice for the digital realm of Augmented Reality (AR).
        These projects are in conversation with commissioned works by <b>hiba ali</b>,
        <b>Casey Koyczan</b>, and <b>Linda Zhang</b>. Gesturing to the precarity
        and subversive nature of street art, the AR installations around Dundas West
        and other corners of the city invite participants to dream in Toronto\u2019s
        fraught public space.\_ <br><br> As a part of the Long Winter residency,
        <b>Ladan Siad</b>\_led a workshop on tensions that arise while using digital
        tools like AR to create art on systemic violence and resistance. Ladan is
        an interdisciplinary storyteller and designer who explores the worlds that
        are possible when radical visionary change flourishes. The workshop discussions
        were an opening on how to \u2014 as Ruha Benjamin puts it \u2014 intervene
        with the deadly status quo. Hypercity curator <b>Mitra</b>\_and Ladan reconnected
        over Zoom to continue this (unending) conversation. <br><br> <b>Mitra:</b>\_As
        you know, the artists part of Hypercity were given a prompt to start their
        projects: \"Who defines it, inherits it, wields it... who rents it, tills
        it, toils for it... who gets expelled from it?\" This line from Ruha Benjamin\u2019s
        <i>Captivating Technology</i>: <i>Race, carceral technoscience and libertory
        imagination </i>(2019) questions who is allowed into the category of human
        and who is excluded. More specifically, at the border, at work, at a checkpoint
        and beyond, subjugated people must petition again and again for admission
        into the category of \u201Chuman\u201D while applications are routinely denied.
        What comes to mind when you read this prompt?\_ <br><br> <b>Ladan: </b>The
        prompt makes me think of Jamaican scholar and theorist Sylvia Wynter\u2019s
        essay \"'No Humans Involved': An Open Letter to My Colleagues\" from 1992.
        I often return to it when thinking about my responsibilities as someone who
        uses and works with technology in a critical way. In this essay, Wynter is
        calling out her colleagues for the ways that their work helps to uphold and
        disseminate problematic constructs of race, gender, class, sexuality, and
        other categories that continue to overdetermine our lived experience and
        justify or deny our humanity. So how does the artistic use of Augmented Reality
        (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Artificial Intelligence (AI) or other surveillance
        system technologies fall into those same traps?\_ <br><br> A lot of aspects
        of my own work are based on conversations. Talking to people about their
        relationships to technological systems and how they maneuver them. Seeing
        how folks make systems work for them, systems that don\u2019t otherwise constitute
        them. Sometimes it\u2019s about <i>not </i>making objects or products. This
        is how I see refusal playing out in my work \u2014 that refusal is a part
        of getting at the question of how these technologies interweave with our
        artistic practices. It also takes the form of demystifying, experimentation
        and play.\_ <br><br> <b>Mitra: </b>Yes. I\u2019m interested in how Wynter\u2019s
        thinking can be applied to our relationships to our non-human kin such as
        plants, animals and pollinators. Shonee\u2019s AR garden of weeds provides
        an example of this, offering a digital space for plants to \u201Covergrow,\u201D
        undomesticated and ungovernable by the utilitarian terms of colonialism.\_
        <br><br> Extending on this idea of being ungovernable, let\u2019s talk about
        riots. Riots are used strategically to criminalize or delegitimize movements
        and demands. I say riots affectionately, I say riots with love. Referring
        to the Los Angeles riots of 1992, Toni Morrison says, \u201CWhat struck me
        most about those who rioted was how long they waited. The restraint they
        showed. Not the spontaneity, the restraint. They waited and waited for justice
        and it didn\u2019t come. No one talks about that\u2026\u201D\_ <br><br> In
        Toronto, it sometimes feels like we live on the brink of a riot. Or that
        we should be rioting (or striking). The housing. The transit. The ever-diminishing
        healthcare. The housing, the housing, the housing. And the list goes on.
        A place ever at its brink, tipping point, boiling point, breaking point,
        point of no return? <br><br> Malik McCoy\u2019s Hypercity AR filter engulfs
        us in a city he and many of us have been locked out of; a digital representation
        of, as Scarborough-based writer Amani Bin Shikhan puts it, \u201CToronto
        burying itself alive at home.\u201D How do you conceptualise riots and, more
        broadly, resistance? In Toronto and/or beyond. <br><br> <b>Ladan: </b>When
        I first came across the work of the Practising Refusal Collective, I began
        to think about refusal differently. Formed in 2015 by theorists Tina Campt
        and Saidiya Hartman, Practicing Refusal Collective is an international Black
        feminist forum of artists and scholars dedicated to initiating dialogues
        on blackness, anti-black violence and black futurity in the twenty-first
        century. Drawing from their vision, \u201CThe \u2018practice of refusal\u2019
        referenced in the group\u2019s title names its rejection of this current
        status quo as liveable. It is a refusal to accept black precarity as inevitable,
        and a refusal to embrace the terms of diminished subjecthood through which
        black subjects are presented.\u201D <br><br> Through this, I started trying
        to find artists and collectives that, through their own work, engage in what
        Tina Campt defines as \u201Cnegation as generative and radically transformative\u201D.
        Put differently, riots lead me back to refusal.\_ <br><br> <b>Mitra: </b>Yes,
        that makes sense.\_ <br><br> <b>Mitra: </b>Toronto is also a city where the
        pulse of international riots is alive, is felt. We are a city of refugees,
        a city of exiles, we will shut down your highway for an injustice happening
        1000s of km away, it\u2019s not 1000s of km away for all of us, we evade
        space and time. <br><br> This feels connected to a lot of your own work on
        diaspora and more specifically, how you beautifully put it: quilting together
        global Black genres into a visual and audio tapestry of home everywhere.
        Could you speak more to this? <br><br> <b>Ladan:</b>\_My work comes from
        the kaleidoscope of identities that I inhabit. I am a Black Muslim Queer
        Trans person even in that mouthful I have to manuever different geographies,
        systems and vernacular. Tinkering and making space for me to learn about
        myself through technologies (djing, filmmaking, designing, coding) has allowed
        me to question and learn about alternative and hidden archives.\_ <br><br>
        <b>Mitra:</b>\_I love this, especially the shout out to so many different
        mediums as sites for exploration and spaces for imagination...\_ <br><br>
        <b>Mitra:</b>\_And finally, let\u2019s talk about dreaming! Digital justice
        advocate Sarah Chander talks about the necessity to recognize that some concepts
        like AI have no revolutionary or liberatory potential insofar that they are
        inherently welded to infrastructures of domination, extraction and oppression.
        She talks about how a lot of tech policy work focuses on \u201Ctransparency\u201D
        and \u201Caccountability\u201D while overlooking the way that technologies
        are woven into broader structures of oppression: colonialism, racial capitalism,
        border industrial complexes, queer and transphobia, the list goes on and
        we\u2019ve talked about it. Sarah goes on to say that far from being unrealistic,
        dreaming is the essence of pragmatism; a proposal that \u201Chow things work
        doesn\u2019t actually work at all (not for us anyways).\u201D <br><br> It\u2019s
        my belief that each of the projects in Hypercity is a dream; an artist\u2019s
        query into what another world could like and a demand for something different.
        Collective dreams, deeply personal dreams and, in most cases, a bit of both.
        Cheyenne Rain LeGrande \u146D\u14A5\u140A\u1427\u1423\_quite literally takes
        up dreams in her collaborative Cree rendition of \u201CDreams\u201D by Fleetwood
        Mac.\_ <br><br> And of course, \u201CWithout new visions we don\u2019t know
        what to build, only what to knock down\u201D (h/t Robin D.G. Kelley). This
        is a veryyy long-winded way of asking you, what do you dream about?\_ <br><br>
        <b>Ladan: </b>These days I have been dreaming\u2026 <br><br> <br><br> <b>Mitra</b>\_is
        a Toronto-based curator interested in sanctuary and indebted to border abolition
        organizing. Mapping the legacies of colonial infrastructure and the resistance
        which has always followed ground and guide her work. She has exhibited at
        the Textile Museum of Canada, the Art Gallery of Guelph, Xpace Cultural Centre,
        La Centrale galerie powerhouse and other galleries and artist-run-centres.
        In her spare time, she listens to music that emerges from Toronto; a since-always
        queer, trans, Black, Indigenous, and diasporic city. <br><br> <b>Ladan Mohamed
        Siad </b>is a Toronto- and New York-based interdisciplinary storyteller and
        designer who explores the relationships between design, technology and the
        universalities of the black diasporic experience. Siad works to tell narratives
        about the world that are possible when radical visionary change flourishes.
        Siad is a self-taught and community supported creative, quilting together
        global black genres into a visual and audio tapestry of home everywhere.
        A theme of Ladan\u2019s work is bringing a studied analysis of race, class
        and gender as they are reflected and impacted by technology, art, design,
        and new media.\_"

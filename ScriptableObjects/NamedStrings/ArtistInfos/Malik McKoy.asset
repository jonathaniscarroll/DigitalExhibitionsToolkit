      ConstantValue: "First and Last is a cityscape simulation encroaching the user\u2019s
        view of the real world. Framing the screen is a circular array of high rise
        buildings receding to a single focal point in a spherical way. The building
        windows display various, distorted angles of the user\u2019s camera feed.
        A fingernail with animated sheen and glimmer sits at the top window of each
        building. Tapping the screen, the user enters a world that is at once otherworldly,
        futuristic and reflective.   First and Last: An artist Talk with Malik McKoy

      ConstantValue: "Malik McKoy is a multimedia artist based in Ajax, Ontario.
        McKoy graduated from OCAD University with a BFA from the Drawing and Painting
        program. McKoy has also graduated from Seneca\u2019s Game Art and Animation
        program. These programs have influenced McKoy\u2019s practice to consist
        of painting and producing computer-generated 3D visuals. Straddling the line
        between analog and digital, McKoy attempts to create a visual world that
        lives across both practices. The subject matter of the work is a reflection
        of the banal qualities of where he is currently based, while translating
        it with a vibrant and playful lens.  Recently, McKoy completed a solo residency
        at the Robert McLaughlin Gallery which concluded with a solo exhibition.
        McKoy has also shown work publicly in various projects and events including
        Nuit Blanche 2022 with The Drake Hotel."

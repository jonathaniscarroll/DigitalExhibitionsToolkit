        co-founding principal at Studio Pararaum (Toronto\u2014Z\xFCrich). Zhang's
        design-research proposes the process of making as a form of cognition; production
        as thought\u2014thinking always translates into making and making into further
        ideas. Through this process, her work explores how community memory, cultural
        heritage, and identity can be embodied through emergent technologies (including
        VR, AR, machine learning, robotics and 3D scanning), lived experience (affect
        theory), matter (ceramics), and material processes (slip casting).    She
        is a 2022 Artist-in-Residence at the EKWC (European Ceramic Work Centre),

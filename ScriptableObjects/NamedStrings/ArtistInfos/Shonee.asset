      ConstantValue: 'Inspired by Peter H. Kahn''s concept of technological nature,
        City Garden exists as a speculative Augmented Reality wildlife preserve.
        Fusing sound and 3D graphics, City Garden imagines a green space where digital
        nature contained within its boundless cyber landscape is allowed to flourish
        and grow wild, remaining undisturbed by humanity for all of eternity.  City
        gardens are locations found within cities which are deemed acceptable for
        nature to exist, as long as what grows there benefits the humans tending
        it. Despite city gardens being highly manicured artifacts of nature, these
        spaces attract many displaced ungovernable non-human citizens still trying
        to survive in cities, like weeds and pollinating insects. City Garden welcomes
        these intruders, allowing hungry caterpillars to roam free to eat as much
        as they can and encouraging plants to grow untamed with the footsteps of
        each visitor. '

      ConstantValue: "Shonee (born Bianca Shonee Arroyo-Kreimes) is a Montreal-based
        Costa Rican-Canadian digital media artist. She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree
        in Film Animation from Concordia University, where she is currently an MFA
        candidate in Intermedia. She is the 2021 recipient of the Emerging Digital
        Artists Award and has presented work at MUTEK, National Film Board of Canada,
        Soci\xE9t\xE9 des arts technologiques and Filmgate Miami. Growing up on the
        edge of a rainforest in Costa Rica nourishes her creative practice as her
        work strives to resurrect the meaning of nature\u2019s place in her own life
        now as both an urbanite and multidisciplinary artist. Within the virtual
        worlds she creates, 3D embodiments of organisms borrow shapes, colours, and
        stories from plants and animals within our own world, while remaining singular.
        This conscious decision is intended to inspire a newly discovered appreciation
        of the endangered, non-human world that humanity often takes for granted
        as her portrayals seek to embody humankind\u2019s seemingly objective and
        narrow misunderstanding of nature in this time of ecological crisis."

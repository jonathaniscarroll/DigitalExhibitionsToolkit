      ConstantValue: "In the post 1979 revolution in Iran, protest, war, natural
        disasters, and devastation have become a part of people\u2019s daily lives.
        From the Iran Iraq war that started 1 year after the revolution and lasted
        for 8 years, to the everyday war that people have with the government. In
        all the protests that emerge in Iran, rooftops have become a safer haven
        for the people. When the sun goes down, you can hear people\u2019s chants
        from the rooftops and out their windows that accompany the people that are
        on the ground and are fighting together against the oppressive regime. Rooftops
        have also been a place of privacy. In a country where its citizens are heavily
        policed and surveilled, rooftops are a place for people to put their satellite
        dishes, gather privately, and protest together. In contemporary Iranian urban
        design, rooftops are underlooked and neglected, but people have turned these
        \u201Cwasted\u201D spaces to grounds for resistance and political movement.
        With the death of Jina (Mahsa) Amini, rooftops have again become activated
        by people and in their bloody, brutal fight/revolution against the Islamic
        Republic regime. This Sunset to Sunrise looping AR activation imagines a
        surreal ascent of a group of young people in Iran from the streets to the
        rooftop through the lens of the artist. It makes an attempt to portray the
        feelings of loss, confusion, nausea, duality, and the continued looping resistance
        of Iranians\u2019 daily lives. Long live the displaced and the oppressed.
        A chant 100 years in the making: Azad\xEE, Jiyan, Jin / \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645"

      ConstantValue: Kasra Goodarznezhad (cassraa) is a Kurdish Iranian new media
        artist based in Toronto mainly focused on Installation and Performance. He
        is a co-founder of Komite and Displaced collectives. His work mainly deals
        with concepts of displacement, repression, memory and censorship. In his
        work, Kasra looks to explore the subjective complexities of being an individual
        living in a society that forces you to behave in ways sanctioned by those
        who hold power.  This work was made in collaboration with Koohyar Habibi
        who took on the sound design and recording of the project. Being Kurdish
        Iranian, in his work Koohyar engages with music as the preservation of cultural
        heritage and in an experimental approach. In his practice, he prioritizes
        texture, rhythm, and tone colour, over the traditional approach of composing
        melody and harmony. He uses electronic music as a medium for exploring ""new""
        sounds. This gives space to musicians to discover and experiment with the
        qualities of ""non-musical"" sounds, and ultimately new musical concepts
        and structures.

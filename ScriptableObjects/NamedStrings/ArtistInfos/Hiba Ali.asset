      ConstantValue: In warming the tones of our heart and spirit, we are greeted
        with the roots of three tropical herbs that Hiba has been practicing with.
        Ashwagandha, turmeric and cloves are used in food and for healing, calming
        and hygiene across Africa, Asia, the Carribean and Latin America. Due to
        the capital-colonial global supply chains, we might best know these herbs
        through their powders or fruit. Here in this AR experience, Hiba, introduces
        us to their roots. Tuning to the body, warming the tones of our heart and
        spirit invites us to touch the roots of the three herbs, breathe through
        a guided-rooted meditation developed for the Hypercity app, and embody the
        power of deep breath.  Accompanying this project, Hiba is offering free warming
        tea packets. Pick-up the tea bags at Xpace Cultural Centre (303 Lansdowne
        Ave, Toronto) from January 13 - March 18 while quantities last.
